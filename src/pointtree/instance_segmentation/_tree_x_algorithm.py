class TreeXAlgorithm(InstanceSegmentationAlgorithm):  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    r"""
    Tree instance segmentation algorithm proposed in `Tockner, Andreas, et al. "Automatic Tree Crown Segmentation \
    Using Dense Forest Point Clouds from Personal Laser Scanning (PLS)." International Journal of Applied Earth \
    Observation and Geoinformation 114 (2022): 103025. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.103025>`__.

    The  individual steps of the algorithm and their parameters are described in the following:

    .. rubric:: 1. Terrain Filtering Using the CSF Algorithm
    In the first step, the algorithm detects terrain points using the Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) algorithm \
    proposed in `Zhang, Wuming, et al. "An Easy-to-Use Airborne LiDAR Data Filtering Method Based on Cloth \
    Simulation." Remote Sensing 8.6 (2016): 501 <https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8060501>`__.

    Parameters:
        csf_classification_threshold (float, optional): Maximum height above the cloth a point can have in order to be
            classified as terrain point (in meters). All points whose distance to the cloth is equal or below this
            threshold are classified as terrain points. Defaults to 0.5 m.
        csf_correct_steep_slope (bool, optional): Whether the cloth should be corrected for steep slopes in a
            post-pressing step. Defaults to `False`.
        csf_iterations (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations. Defaults to 100.
        csf_resolution (float, optional): Resolution of the cloth grid (in meters). Defaults to 0.25 m.
        csf_rigidness (int, optional): Rigidness of the cloth (the three levels 1, 2, and 3 are available, where 1 is
            the lowest and 3 the highest rigidness). Defaults to 3.

    .. rubric:: 2. Construction of a Digital Terrain Model
    In the next step, a rasterized digital terrain model (DTM) is constructed from the terrain points identified in the
    previous step. For this purpose, a grid of regularly arranged DTM points is created and the height of the :math:`k`
    closest terrain points is interpolated to obtain the height of each DTM point on the grid. In the interpolation,
    terrain points :math:`p_t` are weighted with a factor proportional to a power of :math:`p` of their inverse distance
    to the corresponding DTM point :math:`p_{dtm}`, i.e., :math:`\frac{1}{||(p_{dtm} - p)||^p}`. Before constructing the
    DTM, the terrain points are downsampled using voxel-based subsampling.

    Parameters:
        dtm_k (int, optional): Number of terrain points between which interpolation is performed to obtain the terrain
            height of a DTM point. Defaults to 500.
        dtm_p (float, optional): Power :math:`p` for inverse-distance weighting in the interpolation of terrain points.
            Defaults to 2.
        dtm_resolution (float, optional): Resolution of the DTM grid (in meters). Defaults to 0.2 m.
        dtm_voxel_size (float, optional): Voxel size with which the terrain points are downsampled before the DTM is
            created (in meters). Defaults to 0.05 m.

    .. rubric:: 3. Identification of Trunk Clusters
    The aim of this step is to identify clusters of points that may represent individual tree trunks, i.e., each
    trunk should be represented by a separate cluster. For this purpose, the point cloud is normalized by subtracting
    the corresponding DTM height from the height of each point. A horizontal slice is then extracted from the
    normalized point cloud, which contains all points within a certain height range above the terrain (the height range
    is defined by :code:`trunk_search_min_z` and :code:`trunk_search_max_z`). This layer should
    be chosen so that it contains all tree trunks and as few other objects as possible. The points within this slice are
    downsampled using voxel-based subsampling and then clustered using the DBSCAN algorithm proposed in
    `Ester, Martin, et al. "A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise." \
    KDD. Vol. 96. No. 34, pp. 226-231. 1996. <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3001460.3001507>`__ The clusters obtained
    with the DBSCAN algorithm may still contain some false positives, i.e., clusters that do not represent trunks. To
    filter out false positive clusters, the following filtering rules are applied to the clusters:

    1. Clusters with less than :code:`trunk_search_min_cluster_points` points are discarded.
    2. Clusters whose extent in the z-direction (i.e., the height difference between the highest and the lowest point in
       the cluster) is less than :code:`trunk_search_min_cluster_height` are discarded.
    3. From the remaining clusters :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_num_layers` horizontal and potentially
       overlapping layers are extracted, each with a height of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_height` and an
       overlap of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_overlap`. A circle or ellipse (if the circle fitting does not
       converge) is fitted to the points from each layer. Then, for all possible combinations of
       :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` layers, the standard deviation of the fitted
       circle or ellipse diameters is computed. If for any of the combinations the standard deviation is smaller than or
       equal to :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_max_std`, the cluster is kept, otherwise it is discarded. A
       multi-stage process is used for the circle or ellipse fitting: First, preliminary circles or ellipses are fitted
       to the layers extracted from point clusters, which do not have the full point density due to the initial
       downsampling. Second, more exact circles or ellipses are fitted. To select the points used for the circle or
       ellipse fitting in this second step, clipping regions are determined based on the preliminary circles or
       ellipses. For this purpose, a buffer area is created around the outline of the respective circle or ellipse. This
       buffer has a width of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_small_buffer_width` if the preliminary trunk diameter is
       less than or equal to :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_switch_buffer_threshold` and otherwise
       :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_large_buffer_width. All points from the full-resoultion point cloud that lie
       within the buffer area are determined and the fitting of the circles or ellipses is repeated using these points.
       If at least :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` circles are found for a cluster, the filtering is
       done based on the fitted circles and the ellipses are not used for the filtering. Otherwise, the clusters are
       filtered based on the fitted ellipses.

    Parameters:
        trunk_search_min_z (float, optional): Height above the terrain at which the horizontal slice begins that is used
            for the DBSCAN clustering (in meters). Defaults to 1 m.

            for the DBSCAN clustering (in meters). Defaults to 3 m.
        trunk_search_voxel_size (float, optional): Voxel size with which the points from the horizontal slice are
            downsampled before performing the DBSCAN clustering (in meters). Defaults to 0.015 m.
        trunk_search_dbscan_eps (float, optional): Parameter :math:`\epsilon` of the DBSCAN algorithm, i.e., the radius
            of the circular neighborhood that is used to determine the number of neighbors for a given point (in
            meters). Defaults to 0.025 m.
        trunk_search_dbscan_min_points (int, optional): Parameter :math:`MinPnts` of the DBSCAN algorithm, i.e., the
            number of neighbors a given point must have in order to be considered as a core point. All neighbors of a
            core point are added to the clusters and then checked whether they are core points themselves. Defaults to
            90.
        trunk_search_min_cluster_points (int, optional): Minimum number of points a cluster must contain in order not to
            be discarded. Defaults to 500.
        trunk_search_min_cluster_height (float, optional): Minimum extent in the z-direction (i.e., the height
            difference between the highest and the lowest point in the cluster) a cluster must have in order not to be

        trunk_search_circle_fitting_num_layers (int, optional): Number of horizontal layers used for the circle /
            ellipse fitting. Depending on the settings for :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_height` and

            that circles must achieve in the circle fitting procedure. If set to :code:`None`, circles are not filtered
            based on their circumferential completeness index. Defaults to :code:`None`.

            clipping area for the circle or ellipse fitting on the full-resolution point cloud if the diameter of the
            preliminary circles or ellipses is less than or equal to
            :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_switch_buffer_threshold` (in meters). Defaults to 0.06 m.
        trunk_search_circle_fitting_large_buffer_width (float, optional): Width of the buffer area for constructing the
            clipping area for the circle or ellipse fitting on the full-resolution point cloud if the diameter of the
            preliminary circles or ellipses is greater than :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_switch_buffer_threshold`
            (in meters). Defaults to 0.09 m.
        trunk_search_circle_fitting_switch_buffer_threshold (float, optional): Threshold for the diameter of the

        trunk_search_ellipse_filter_threshold (float, optional): In the final ellipse fitting, ellipses are only kept if
            the ratio of the radius along the semi-minor axis to the radius along the semi-major axis is greater than or
            equal to this threshold. Defaults to 0.6.
        trunk_search_circle_fitting_max_std (float, optional): Threshold for filtering the trunk clusters based on the
            standard deviation of the diameters of the fitted circles / ellipses. If there is at
            least one combination of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` layers for which the standard
            deviation of the diameters of the fitted circles / ellipses is below or equal to this threshold, the cluster
            is kept, otherwise it is discarded.
        trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers (int, optional): Number of horizontal layers to consider in each
            sample for calculating the standard deviation of the diameters of the fitted circles / ellipses. Defaults to
            6.

    .. rubric:: 4. Computation of Tree Positions and Trunk Diameters
    In this step, the trunk clusters obtained in the previous step are used to compute the trunk centers and trunk
    diameters at breast height. For this purpose, the circles and ellipses fitted in the previous step are used. For
    each trunk, the combination of those six circles or six ellipses (if not enough circles were detected) is selected
    whose radii have the lowest standard deviation. To estimate the trunk position at breast height, a linear model is
    fitted that predicts the center position of the selected circles or ellipses from the layer height. The prediction
    of the fitted model for a height of 1.3 m is used as an estimate of the trunk position at breast height. To estimate
    the trunk diameter at breast height, the trunk radius for each of the six selected layers is estimated by fitting a
    generalized additive model (GAM) to the points from each layer (only the points within the clipping area created in
    the previous step are used). Before fitting the GAM, the input points are centered around the circle / ellipse
    center and converted into polar coordinates. The GAM is then used to predict the radius part of the polar
    coordinates from the angle part. Using the fitted GAM, the bounding polygon of the trunk is predicted and the trunk
    radius is estimated based on the area of this bounding polygon. Finally, a linear model is fitted that predicts the
    trunk radius from the layer height. The prediction of the fitted model for a height of 1.3 m is used as an estimate
    of the trunk radius at breast height.

    .. rubric:: 5. Tree Segmentation Using Region Growing
    In this step, the points are downsampled using voxel-based subsampling and subsequently a point-wise segmentation of
    the individual trees is generated using a region growing procedure. In the
    first step, the region growing procedure selects an initial set of seed points for each tree. These should be points
    that are very likely to belong to the corresponding tree. In an iterative process, the sets of points assigned to
    each tree are then expanded. In each iteration, the neighboring points of each seed point within a certain search
    radius are determined. Neighboring points that are not yet assigned to any tree are added to the same tree as the
    seed point and become seed points in the next iteration. The region growing continues until there are no more seed
    points to be processed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

    To select the initial seed points for a given tree, the following approach is used: A cylinder with a height of
    :code:`region_growing_seed_layer_height` and a diameter of :code:`region_growing_seed_radius_factor * d` is
    considered, where :code:`d` is the tree's trunk diameter at breast height, which has been computed in the previous
    step. The cylinder's center is positioned at the trunk center at breast height, which also has been computed in the
    previous step. All points within the cylinder are selected as seed points.

    The search radius for the iterative region growing procedure is set as follows: First, the search radius is set to
    the voxel size used for voxel-based subsampling, which is performed before region growing. The search radius is
    increased by the voxel size if one of the following conditions is fulfilled at the end of a region growing
    iteration:

    1. The ratio between the number of points newly assigned to trees in the iteration and the number of remaining,
       unassigned points is below :code:`region_growing_min_total_assignment_ratio`.
    2. The ratio between the number of trees to which new points have been assigned in the iteration and the total
       number of trees is below :code:`region_growing_min_tree_assignment_ratio`.

    The search radius is increased up to a maximum radius of :code:`region_growing_max_search_radius`. If the search
    radius has not been increased for :code:`region_growing_decrease_search_radius_after_num_iter`, it is reduced by the
    voxel size.

    To promote upward growth, the z-coordinates of the points are divided by :code:`region_growing_z_scale` before the
    region growing.

    Since the terrain filtering in the first step of the algorithm may be inaccurate and some tree points may be falsely
    classified as terrain points, both terrain and non-terrain points are considered by the region growing procedure.
    However, to prevent large portions of terrain points from being included in tree instances, terrain points are only
    assigned to if their cumulative search distance from the initial seed point is below the threshold defined by
    :code:`region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_ground`. The cumulative search distance is defined as the total
    distance traveled between consecutive points until reaching a terrain point.

    Parameters:
        region_growing_voxel_size (float, optional): Voxel size with which the points are downsampled before
            the region growing (in meters). Defaults to 0.05 m.
        region_growing_z_scale (float, optional): Factor by which to divide the z-coordinates of the points before
            the region growing. To promote upward growth, this factor should be larger than 1. Defaults to 2.
        region_growing_seed_layer_height (float, optional): Height of the cylinders that are placed around the trunk
            centers at breast height for seed point selection (in meters). Defaults to 0.6 m.
        region_growing_seed_radius_factor (float, optional): Factor to multiply with the trunk diameter at breast height
            to obtain the diameter of the cylinder used for seed point selection. Defaults to 1.2.
        region_growing_min_total_assignment_ratio (float, optional): Threshold controlling when to increase the search
            radius. If the ratio between the number of points newly assigned to trees in an iteration and the number of
            remaining, unassigned points is below this threshold, the search radius is increased by
            :code:`region_growing_voxel_size` up to a maximum search radius of :code:`region_growing_max_search_radius`.
            Defaults to 0.002.
        region_growing_min_tree_assignment_ratio (float, optional): Threshold controlling when to increase the search
            radius. If the ratio between the number of trees to which new points have been assigned in the iteration and
            the total number of trees is below this threshold, the search radius is increased by
            :code:`region_growing_voxel_size` up to a maximum search radius of :code:`region_growing_max_search_radius`.
            Defaults to 0.3.
        region_growing_max_search_radius (float, optional): Maximum search radius (in meters). Defaults to 0.5 m.
        region_growing_decrease_search_radius_after_num_iter (int, optional): Number of region growing iterations after
            which to decrease the search radius by :code:`region_growing_voxel_size` if it has not been increased in
            these iterations. Defaults to 10.
        region_growing_max_iterations (int, optional): Maximum number of region growing iterations. Defaults to 1000.
        region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_terrain (float, optional): Maximum cumulative search distance between the
            initial seed point and a terrain point to include that terrain point in a tree instance (in meters).
            Defaults to 2 m.
        visualization_folder: Path of a directory in which to store visualizations of intermediate results of the
            algorithm. Defaults to :code:`None`, which means that no visualizations are created.

        within the buffer area are determined and the fitting of the circles or ellipses is done using only these
        points.

        In the ellipse fitting, ellipses are only kept if the ratio of the radius along the semi-minor axis to the

            Tuple of four elements. The first is an array that contains the parameters of the circles that were fitted
            to the layers of each cluster. Each circle is represented by three values, namely the x- and y-coordinates
            of its center and its radius. If the circle fitting did not converge for a layer, all parameters are set to
            -1. The second is an array that contains the parameters of the ellipses that were fitted to the layers of
            each cluster. Each ellipse is represented by five values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center, its
            radius along the semi-major and along the semi-minor axis, and the counterclockwise angle of rotation from
            the x-axis to the semi-major axis of the ellipse. If the ellipse fitting results in an ellipse whose axis
            ratio is smaller than :code:`self._trunk_search_ellipse_filter_threshold`, all parameters are set to -1.
            The third is an array that contains the z-coordinate of the midpoint of each horizontal layer. The fourth is
            a nested list that contains one array for each horizontal layer of each cluster, containing the x- and
            y-coordinates of the points that were selected for the circle and ellipse fitting in that layer based on the
            preliminary circles or ellipses.

        Filters the point clusters that may represent individual tree trunks based on the circles and ellipses fitted to
        different horizontal layers of the clusters. For each cluster, the standard deviation of the fitted circle or
        ellipse diameters is computed for all possible combinations of
        :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` layers. If for any of the combinations the standard
        deviation is smaller than or equal to :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_max_std`, the cluster is kept,
        otherwise it is discarded. If at least :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` circles are have
        been found for a trunk cluster, only the fitted circles are considered for this filtering step. Otherwise, the
        filtering is done based on the fitted ellipses.

        Args:
            layer_circles: Parameters of the circles that were fitted to the horizontal layers of each cluster. Each
                circle must be represented by three values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center and its
                radius. If no circle was found for a certain layer, the circle parameters for that layer must be set to
                -1.
            layer_ellipses: Parameters of the ellipses that were fitted to the horizontal layers of each cluster. Each
                ellipse must represented by five values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center, its
                radius along the semi-major and along the semi-minor axis, and the counterclockwise angle of rotation
                from the x-axis to the semi-major axis of the ellipse. If no ellipse was found for a certain layer, the
                ellipse parameters for that layer must be set to -1.

            Tuple of three arrays. The first array contains a boolean mask indicating which trunk clusters are retained
            after the filtering. The second contains the indices of the combination of layers with the lowest standard
            deviation of the circle diameters for each cluster. If for a trunk cluster less than
            :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` circles were found, the indices for that cluster
            are set to -1. The third array contains the indices of the combination of layers with the lowest standard
            deviation of the ellipse diameters for each cluster. If more than

        Computes a point-wise segmentation of the individual trees using a region growing procedure. In the first step,
        the region growing procedure selects an initial set of seed points for each tree. These should be points
        that are very likely to belong to the corresponding tree. In an iterative process, the sets of points assigned
        to each tree are then expanded. In each iteration, the neighboring points of each seed point within a certain
        search radius are determined. Neighboring points that are not yet assigned to any tree are added to the same
        tree as the seed point and become seed points in the next iteration. The region growing continues until there
        are no more seed points to be processed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

        To select the initial seed points for a given tree, the following approach is used: A cylinder with a height of
        :code:`region_growing_seed_layer_height` and a diameter of :code:`self._region_growing_seed_radius_factor * d`
        is considered, where :code:`d` is the tree's trunk diameter at breast height, which has been computed in the
        previous step. The cylinder's center is positioned at the trunk center at breast height, which also has been
        computed in the previous step. All points within the cylinder are selected as seed points.

        The search radius for the iterative region growing procedure is set as follows: First, the search radius is set
        to the voxel size used for voxel-based subsampling, which is performed before region growing. The search radius
        is increased by the voxel size if one of the following conditions is fulfilled at the end of a region growing
        iteration:

        1. The ratio between the number of points newly assigned to trees in the iteration and the number of remaining,
        unassigned points is below :code:`self._region_growing_min_total_assignment_ratio`.
        2. The ratio between the number of trees to which new points have been assigned in the iteration and the total
        number of trees is below :code:`self._region_growing_min_tree_assignment_ratio`.

        The search radius is increased up to a maximum radius of :code:`self._region_growing_max_search_radius`. If the
        search radius has not been increased for :code:`self._region_growing_decrease_search_radius_after_num_iter`, it
        is reduced by the voxel size.

        To promote upward growth, the z-coordinates of the points are divided by :code:`region_growing_z_scale` before
        the region growing.

        Since the terrain filtering in the first step of the algorithm may be inaccurate and some tree points may be
        falsely classified as terrain points, both terrain and non-terrain points are considered by the region growing
        procedure. However, to prevent large portions of terrain points from being included in tree instances, terrain
        points are only assigned to if their cumulative search distance from the initial seed point is below the
        threshold defined by :code:`self._region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_ground`. The cumulative search distance
        is defined as the total distance traveled between consecutive points until reaching a terrain point.

        Args:
            xyz: Non-normalized coordinates of the points which to consider in the region growing. This can include
                both terrain and non-terrain points.
            distance_to_dtm: Height of each point above the ground.
            is_tree: Boolean array indicating which points have been identified as potential tree points, i.e.,
                non-vegetation points. The points for which the corresponding entry is :code:`True` are considered in
                all region growing iterations, while terrain points are only considered if the cumulative search
                distance is below the threshold defined by :code:`_region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_ground`.
            tree_positions: X- and y-coordinates of the positions of the trees to be used for seed point selection.
            trunk_diameters: Trunk diameters of of the trees to be used for seed point selection.

        Returns:
            Tree instance labels for all points. For points not belonging to any tree, the label is set to -1.
