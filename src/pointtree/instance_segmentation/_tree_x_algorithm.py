class TreeXAlgorithm(InstanceSegmentationAlgorithm):  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    r"""
    Tree instance segmentation algorithm proposed in `Tockner, Andreas, et al. "Automatic Tree Crown Segmentation \
    Using Dense Forest Point Clouds from Personal Laser Scanning (PLS)." International Journal of Applied Earth \
    Observation and Geoinformation 114 (2022): 103025. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.103025>`__.

    The  individual steps of the algorithm and their parameters are described in the following:

    .. rubric:: 1. Terrain Filtering Using the CSF Algorithm
    In the first step, the algorithm detects terrain points using the Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) algorithm \
    proposed in `Zhang, Wuming, et al. "An Easy-to-Use Airborne LiDAR Data Filtering Method Based on Cloth \
    Simulation." Remote Sensing 8.6 (2016): 501 <https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8060501>`__.

    Parameters:
        csf_classification_threshold (float, optional): Maximum height above the cloth a point can have in order to be
            classified as terrain point (in meters). All points whose distance to the cloth is equal or below this
            threshold are classified as terrain points. Defaults to 0.5 m.
        csf_correct_steep_slope (bool, optional): Whether the cloth should be corrected for steep slopes in a
            post-pressing step. Defaults to `False`.
        csf_iterations (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations. Defaults to 100.
        csf_resolution (float, optional): Resolution of the cloth grid (in meters). Defaults to 0.25 m.
        csf_rigidness (int, optional): Rigidness of the cloth (the three levels 1, 2, and 3 are available, where 1 is
            the lowest and 3 the highest rigidness). Defaults to 3.

    .. rubric:: 2. Construction of a Digital Terrain Model
    In the next step, a rasterized digital terrain model (DTM) is constructed from the terrain points identified in the
    previous step. For this purpose, a grid of regularly arranged DTM points is created and the height of the :math:`k`
    closest terrain points is interpolated to obtain the height of each DTM point on the grid. In the interpolation,
    terrain points :math:`p_t` are weighted with a factor proportional to a power of :math:`p` of their inverse distance
    to the corresponding DTM point :math:`p_{dtm}`, i.e., :math:`\frac{1}{||(p_{dtm} - p)||^p}`. Before constructing the
    DTM, the terrain points are downsampled using voxel-based subsampling.

    Parameters:
        dtm_k (int, optional): Number of terrain points between which interpolation is performed to obtain the terrain
            height of a DTM point. Defaults to 500.
        dtm_p (float, optional): Power :math:`p` for inverse-distance weighting in the interpolation of terrain points.
            Defaults to 2.
        dtm_resolution (float, optional): Resolution of the DTM grid (in meters). Defaults to 0.2 m.
        dtm_voxel_size (float, optional): Voxel size with which the terrain points are downsampled before the DTM is
            created (in meters). Defaults to 0.05 m.

    .. rubric:: 3. Identification of Trunk Clusters
    The aim of this step is to identify clusters of points that may represent individual tree trunks, i.e., each
    trunk should be represented by a separate cluster. For this purpose, the point cloud is normalized by subtracting
    the corresponding DTM height from the height of each point. A horizontal slice is then extracted from the
    normalized point cloud, which contains all points within a certain height range above the terrain (the height range
    is defined by :code:`trunk_search_min_z` and :code:`trunk_search_max_z`). This layer should
    be chosen so that it contains all tree trunks and as few other objects as possible. The points within this slice are
    downsampled using voxel-based subsampling and then clustered using the DBSCAN algorithm proposed in
    `Ester, Martin, et al. "A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise." \
    KDD. Vol. 96. No. 34, pp. 226-231. 1996. <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3001460.3001507>`__ The clusters obtained
    with the DBSCAN algorithm may still contain some false positives, i.e., clusters that do not represent trunks. To
    filter out false positive clusters, the following filtering rules are applied to the clusters:

    1. Clusters with less than :code:`trunk_search_min_cluster_points` points are discarded.
    2. Clusters whose extent in the z-direction (i.e., the height difference between the highest and the lowest point in
       the cluster) is less than :code:`trunk_search_min_cluster_height` are discarded.
    3. From the remaining clusters :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_num_layers` horizontal and potentially
       overlapping layers are extracted, each with a height of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_height` and an
       overlap of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_overlap`. A circle or ellipse (if the circle fitting does not
       converge) is fitted to the points from each layer. Then, for all possible combinations of
       :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` layers, the standard deviation of the fitted
       circle or ellipse diameters is computed. If for any of the combinations the standard deviation is smaller than or
       equal to :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_max_std`, the cluster is kept, otherwise it is discarded. A
       multi-stage process is used for the circle or ellipse fitting: First, preliminary circles or ellipses are fitted
       to the layers extracted from point clusters, which do not have the full point density due to the initial
       downsampling. Second, more exact circles or ellipses are fitted. To select the points used for the circle or
       ellipse fitting in this second step, clipping regions are determined based on the preliminary circles or
       ellipses. For this purpose, a buffer area is created around the outline of the respective circle or ellipse. This
       buffer has a width of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_small_buffer_width` if the preliminary trunk diameter is
       less than or equal to :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_switch_buffer_threshold` and otherwise
       :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_large_buffer_width. All points from the full-resoultion point cloud that lie
       within the buffer area are determined and the fitting of the circles or ellipses is repeated using these points.
       If at least :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` circles are found for a cluster, the filtering is
       done based on the fitted circles and the ellipses are not used for the filtering. Otherwise, the clusters are
       filtered based on the fitted ellipses.

    Parameters:
        trunk_search_min_z (float, optional): Height above the terrain at which the horizontal slice begins that is used
            for the DBSCAN clustering (in meters). Defaults to 1 m.

            of the circular neighborhood that is used to determine the number of neighbors for a given point (in
            meters). Defaults to 0.025 m.
        trunk_search_dbscan_min_points (int, optional): Parameter :math:`MinPnts` of the DBSCAN algorithm, i.e., the
            number of neighbors a given point must have in order to be considered as a core point. All neighbors of a
            core point are added to the clusters and then checked whether they are core points themselves. Defaults to
            90.

            be discarded. Defaults to 500.
        trunk_search_min_cluster_height (float, optional): Minimum extent in the z-direction (i.e., the height
            difference between the highest and the lowest point in the cluster) a cluster must have in order not to be

            clipping area for the circle or ellipse fitting on the full-resolution point cloud if the diameter of the
            preliminary circles or ellipses is less than or equal to
            :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_switch_buffer_threshold` (in meters). Defaults to 0.06 m.

            equal to this threshold. Defaults to 0.6.
        trunk_search_circle_fitting_max_std (float, optional): Threshold for filtering the trunk clusters based on the

            least one combination of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers` layers for which the standard

            is kept, otherwise it is discarded.
        trunk_search_circle_fitting_std_num_layers (int, optional): Number of horizontal layers to consider in each
            sample for calculating the standard deviation of the diameters of the fitted circles / ellipses. Defaults to
            6.

    .. rubric:: 4. Computation of Tree Positions and Trunk Diameters
    In this step, the trunk clusters obtained in the previous step are used to compute the trunk centers and trunk
    diameters at breast height. For this purpose, the circles and ellipses fitted in the previous step are used. For
    each trunk, the combination of those six circles or six ellipses (if not enough circles were detected) is selected
    whose radii have the lowest standard deviation. To estimate the trunk position at breast height, a linear model is
    fitted that predicts the center position of the selected circles or ellipses from the layer height. The prediction
    of the fitted model for a height of 1.3 m is used as an estimate of the trunk position at breast height. To estimate
    the trunk diameter at breast height, the trunk radius for each of the six selected layers is estimated by fitting a
    generalized additive model (GAM) to the points from each layer (only the points within the clipping area created in
    the previous step are used). Before fitting the GAM, the input points are centered around the circle / ellipse
    center and converted into polar coordinates. The GAM is then used to predict the radius part of the polar
    coordinates from the angle part. Using the fitted GAM, the bounding polygon of the trunk is predicted and the trunk
    radius is estimated based on the area of this bounding polygon. Finally, a linear model is fitted that predicts the
    trunk radius from the layer height. The prediction of the fitted model for a height of 1.3 m is used as an estimate
    of the trunk radius at breast height.

    .. rubric:: 5. Tree Segmentation Using Region Growing
    In this step, the points are downsampled using voxel-based subsampling and subsequently a point-wise segmentation of
    the individual trees is generated using a region growing procedure. In the
    first step, the region growing procedure selects an initial set of seed points for each tree. These should be points
    that are very likely to belong to the corresponding tree. In an iterative process, the sets of points assigned to
    each tree are then expanded. In each iteration, the neighboring points of each seed point within a certain search
    radius are determined. Neighboring points that are not yet assigned to any tree are added to the same tree as the
    seed point and become seed points in the next iteration. The region growing continues until there are no more seed
    points to be processed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

    To select the initial seed points for a given tree, the following approach is used: A cylinder with a height of
    :code:`region_growing_seed_layer_height` and a diameter of :code:`region_growing_seed_radius_factor * d` is
    considered, where :code:`d` is the tree's trunk diameter at breast height, which has been computed in the previous
    step. The cylinder's center is positioned at the trunk center at breast height, which also has been computed in the
    previous step. All points within the cylinder are selected as seed points.

    The search radius for the iterative region growing procedure is set as follows: First, the search radius is set to
    the voxel size used for voxel-based subsampling, which is performed before region growing. The search radius is
    increased by the voxel size if one of the following conditions is fulfilled at the end of a region growing
    iteration:

    1. The ratio between the number of points newly assigned to trees in the iteration and the number of remaining,
       unassigned points is below :code:`region_growing_min_total_assignment_ratio`.
    2. The ratio between the number of trees to which new points have been assigned in the iteration and the total
       number of trees is below :code:`region_growing_min_tree_assignment_ratio`.

    The search radius is increased up to a maximum radius of :code:`region_growing_max_search_radius`. If the search
    radius has not been increased for :code:`region_growing_decrease_search_radius_after_num_iter`, it is reduced by the
    voxel size.

    To promote upward growth, the z-coordinates of the points are divided by :code:`region_growing_z_scale` before the
    region growing.

    Since the terrain filtering in the first step of the algorithm may be inaccurate and some tree points may be falsely
    classified as terrain points, both terrain and non-terrain points are considered by the region growing procedure.
    However, to prevent large portions of terrain points from being included in tree instances, terrain points are only
    assigned to if their cumulative search distance from the initial seed point is below the threshold defined by
    :code:`region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_ground`. The cumulative search distance is defined as the total
    distance traveled between consecutive points until reaching a terrain point.

    Parameters:
        region_growing_voxel_size (float, optional): Voxel size with which the points are downsampled before
            the region growing (in meters). Defaults to 0.05 m.
        region_growing_z_scale (float, optional): Factor by which to divide the z-coordinates of the points before
            the region growing. To promote upward growth, this factor should be larger than 1. Defaults to 2.
        region_growing_seed_layer_height (float, optional): Height of the cylinders that are placed around the trunk
            centers at breast height for seed point selection (in meters). Defaults to 0.6 m.
        region_growing_seed_radius_factor (float, optional): Factor to multiply with the trunk diameter at breast height
            to obtain the diameter of the cylinder used for seed point selection. Defaults to 1.2.
        region_growing_min_total_assignment_ratio (float, optional): Threshold controlling when to increase the search
            radius. If the ratio between the number of points newly assigned to trees in an iteration and the number of
            remaining, unassigned points is below this threshold, the search radius is increased by
            :code:`region_growing_voxel_size` up to a maximum search radius of :code:`region_growing_max_search_radius`.
            Defaults to 0.002.
        region_growing_min_tree_assignment_ratio (float, optional): Threshold controlling when to increase the search
            radius. If the ratio between the number of trees to which new points have been assigned in the iteration and
            the total number of trees is below this threshold, the search radius is increased by
            :code:`region_growing_voxel_size` up to a maximum search radius of :code:`region_growing_max_search_radius`.
            Defaults to 0.3.
        region_growing_max_search_radius (float, optional): Maximum search radius (in meters). Defaults to 0.5 m.
        region_growing_decrease_search_radius_after_num_iter (int, optional): Number of region growing iterations after
            which to decrease the search radius by :code:`region_growing_voxel_size` if it has not been increased in
            these iterations. Defaults to 10.
        region_growing_max_iterations (int, optional): Maximum number of region growing iterations. Defaults to 1000.
        region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_terrain (float, optional): Maximum cumulative search distance between the
            initial seed point and a terrain point to include that terrain point in a tree instance (in meters).
            Defaults to 2 m.
        num_workers (int, optional): Number of workers to use for parallel processing. If :code:`workers` is set to -1,
            all CPU threads are used. Defaults to :code:`-1`.
        visualization_folder (str | pathlib.Path, optional): Path of a directory in which to store visualizations of
            intermediate results of the algorithm. Defaults to :code:`None`, which means that no visualizations are
            created.

        Given a set of point clusters that may represent individual tree trunks, circles are fitted to multiple
        horinzontal layers of each cluster. If the circle fitting does not converge, an ellipse is fitted instead. If a
        horizontal layer contains less than :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_min_points` points, neither a
        circle nor an ellipse is fitted. To obtain the horizontal layers,
        :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_num_layers` horizontal layers with a height of
        :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_height` are created starting at a height of
        :code:`self._trunk_search_min_z`. The layers have an overlap of
        :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_overlap` to the previous layer. Hence, the last layer ends at
        :code:`self._trunk_search_min_z + self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_num_layers * \
        (self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_height - self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_overlap)`.

        Args:
            trunk_layer_xyz: Coordinates of the points from the trunk layer.
            cluster_labels: Indices indicating to which cluster each point belongs. Points not belonging to any cluster
                should be assigned the ID -1.
            unique_cluster_labels: Unique cluster labels, i.e., an array that should contain each cluster ID once. The
                cluster IDs are expected to start with zero and to be in a continuous range.
            point_cloud_id: ID of the point cloud to be used in the file names of the visualization results. Defaults to
                :code:`None`, which means that no visualizations are created.

        Returns:
            Parameters of the circles or ellipses that were fitted to the layers of each cluster. Each circle is
            represented by three values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center and its
            radius. Each ellipse is represented by five values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center, its
            radius along the semi-major and along the semi-minor axis, and the counterclockwise angle of rotation from
            the x-axis to the semi-major axis of the ellipse. The parameters of the circles
            and ellipses are stored in a single array. Circles and ellipses can be distinguished by checking the fourth
            or fifth value, which are set to -1 for circles. If neither a circle nor an ellipse
            was fitted, all values are set to -1.

        r"""
        Given a set of point clusters that may represent individual tree trunks, circles are fitted to multiple
        horinzontal layers of each cluster. To obtain the horizontal layers,
        :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_num_layers` horizontal layers with a height of
        :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_height` are created starting at a height of
        :code:`self._trunk_search_min_z`. The layers have an overlap of
        :code:`self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_overlap` to the previous layer. Hence, the last layer ends at
        :code:`self._trunk_search_min_z + self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_num_layers * \
        (self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_height - self._trunk_search_circle_fitting_layer_overlap)`.

        The points used for the circle and ellipse fitting in each layer are selected based on the results of a
        preliminary circle or ellipse fitting. For this purpose, a buffer area is created around the outline of the
        respective circle or ellipse. This buffer has a width of :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_small_buffer_width`
        if the preliminary circle or ellipse diameter is less than or equal to
        :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_switch_buffer_threshold` and otherwise
        :code:`trunk_search_circle_fitting_large_buffer_width. All points from the respective layer that lie
        within the buffer area are determined and the fitting of the circles or ellipses is done using only these
        points.

        In the ellipse fitting, ellipses are only kept if the ratio of the radius along the semi-minor axis to the
        radius along the semi-major axis is greater than or equal to `self._trunk_search_ellipse_filter_threshold`.

        Args:
            trunk_layer_xyz: Coordinates of the points from the trunk layer.
            preliminary_layer_circles_or_ellipses: Parameters of the preliminary circles or ellipses. Each circle must
                be represented by three values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center and its radius. Each
                ellipse must represented by five values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center, its
                radius along the semi-major and along the semi-minor axis, and the counterclockwise angle of rotation
                from the x-axis to the semi-major axis of the ellipse. The parameters of the circles
                and ellipses must stored in a single array, where the fourth and fifth value must be set to -1 for
                circles. If the preliminary fitting was unsucessfull for the respective layer, all values must be set to
                -1.
            point_cloud_id: ID of the point cloud to be used in the file names of the visualization results. Defaults to
                :code:`None`, which means that no visualizations are created.

        Returns:
            Tuple of five array. The first array contains the parameters of the circles that were fitted to the layers
            of each cluster. Each circle is represented by three values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center
            and its radius. If the circle fitting did not converge for a layer, all parameters are set to -1. The second
            array contains the parameters of the ellipses that were fitted to the layers of each cluster. Each ellipse
            is represented by five values, namely the x- and y-coordinates of its center, its radius along the
            semi-major and along the semi-minor axis, and the counterclockwise angle of rotation from the x-axis to
            the semi-major axis of the ellipse. If the ellipse fitting results in an ellipse whose axis ratio is smaller
            than :code:`self._trunk_search_ellipse_filter_threshold`, all parameters are set to -1. The third array
            contains the z-coordinate of the midpoint of each horizontal layer. The fourth array contains the
            x- and y-coordinates of the points in each horizontal layer of each cluster that were selected for the
            circle and ellipse fitting in that layer based on the preliminary circles or ellipses. Points belonging to
            the same layer of the same cluster are stored consecutively. The fifth array contains the number of points
            belonging to each horizontal layer of each cluster.

        Estimates the radius of a tree trunk using a GAM. It is assumed that a circle or an ellipse has already been
        fitted to the points of the tree trunk. To create the GAM, the points are converted into polar coordinates,
        using the center of the previously fitted circle or ellipse as the coordinate origin. The GAM is then fitted to
        predict the radius of the points based on the angles. The fitted GAM is then used to predict the trunk's
        boundary polygon and the trunk radius is computed from the area of the boundary polygon.

            points: Points belonging to the trunk slice for which to estimate the radius
            center: Center of the circle or ellipse that has been fitted to the trunk.

        Computes a point-wise segmentation of the individual trees using a region growing procedure. In the first step,
        the region growing procedure selects an initial set of seed points for each tree. These should be points
        that are very likely to belong to the corresponding tree. In an iterative process, the sets of points assigned
        to each tree are then expanded. In each iteration, the neighboring points of each seed point within a certain
        search radius are determined. Neighboring points that are not yet assigned to any tree are added to the same
        tree as the seed point and become seed points in the next iteration. The region growing continues until there
        are no more seed points to be processed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

        To select the initial seed points for a given tree, the following approach is used: A cylinder with a height of
        :code:`region_growing_seed_layer_height` and a diameter of :code:`self._region_growing_seed_radius_factor * d`
        is considered, where :code:`d` is the tree's trunk diameter at breast height, which has been computed in the
        previous step. The cylinder's center is positioned at the trunk center at breast height, which also has been
        computed in the previous step. All points within the cylinder are selected as seed points.

        The search radius for the iterative region growing procedure is set as follows: First, the search radius is set
        to the voxel size used for voxel-based subsampling, which is performed before region growing. The search radius
        is increased by the voxel size if one of the following conditions is fulfilled at the end of a region growing
        iteration:

        1. The ratio between the number of points newly assigned to trees in the iteration and the number of remaining,
        unassigned points is below :code:`self._region_growing_min_total_assignment_ratio`.
        2. The ratio between the number of trees to which new points have been assigned in the iteration and the total
        number of trees is below :code:`self._region_growing_min_tree_assignment_ratio`.

        The search radius is increased up to a maximum radius of :code:`self._region_growing_max_search_radius`. If the
        search radius has not been increased for :code:`self._region_growing_decrease_search_radius_after_num_iter`, it
        is reduced by the voxel size.

        To promote upward growth, the z-coordinates of the points are divided by :code:`region_growing_z_scale` before
        the region growing.

        Since the terrain filtering in the first step of the algorithm may be inaccurate and some tree points may be
        falsely classified as terrain points, both terrain and non-terrain points are considered by the region growing
        procedure. However, to prevent large portions of terrain points from being included in tree instances, terrain
        points are only assigned to if their cumulative search distance from the initial seed point is below the
        threshold defined by :code:`self._region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_ground`. The cumulative search distance
        is defined as the total distance traveled between consecutive points until reaching a terrain point.

        Args:
            xyz: Non-normalized coordinates of the points which to consider in the region growing. This can include
                both terrain and non-terrain points.
            dists_to_dtm: Height of each point above the ground.
            is_tree: Boolean array indicating which points have been identified as potential tree points, i.e.,
                non-vegetation points. The points for which the corresponding entry is :code:`True` are considered in
                all region growing iterations, while terrain points are only considered if the cumulative search
                distance is below the threshold defined by :code:`_region_growing_cum_search_dist_include_ground`.
            tree_positions: X- and y-coordinates of the positions of the trees to be used for seed point selection.
            trunk_diameters: Trunk diameters of of the trees to be used for seed point selection.

        Returns:
            Tree instance labels for all points. For points not belonging to any tree, the label is set to -1.
