    Computes the indices of `k` nearest neighbors. Decides between different implementations:

    - **Implementation from PyTorch3D:** This implementation is always used if PyTorch3D is installed because its more \
      efficient in terms of runtime and memory consumption than the other available implementations.
    - **Implementation from torch-cluster:** This implementation is used when PyTorch3D is not installed. It is \
      similar to the PyTorch3D implementation but is slighlty slower.

    Args:
        coords_support_points: Coordinates of the support points to be searched for neighbors.
        coords_query_points: Coordinates of the query points.
        batch_indices_support_points: Indices indicating to which point cloud in the batch each support point belongs.
        batch_indices_query_points: Indices indicating to which point cloud in the batch each query point belongs.
        point_cloud_sizes_support_points: Number of points in each point cloud in the batch of support points.
        point_cloud_sizes_query_points: Number of points in each point cloud in the batch of query points.
        k: The number of nearest neighbors to search.
        return_sorted: Whether the returned neighbors should be sorted by their distance to the query point. Defaults to
            `True`. Setting it to `False` can improve performance for some implementations.

    Returns:
        Tuple of two tensors. The first tensor contains the indices of the neighbors of each query point. The
        second tensor contains the distances between the neighbors and the query points.
