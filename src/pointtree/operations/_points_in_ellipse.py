    Tests whether 2D points are within the boundaries of an ellipse.

    Args:
        xy: Coordinates of the points to test.
        ellipse: Parameters of the ellipse in the following order: X- and y-coordinates of its center, radius along the
            semi-major and along the semi-minor axis, and the counterclockwise angle of rotation from the x-axis to the
            semi-major axis of the ellipse.

    Returns:
        Boolean array that indicates for each point whether it lies within the ellipse.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the shape of :code:`xy` or :code:`ellipse` is invalid.

    Shape:
        - :code:`xy`: :math:`(N, 2)`
        - :code:`ellipse`: :math:`(5)`
        - :code:`batch_indices_query_points`: :math:`(N')`
