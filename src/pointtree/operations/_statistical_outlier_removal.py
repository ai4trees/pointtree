    r"""
    Statistical outlier filter for 3D point clouds: First, it computes the average distance that each point has to
    its k nearest neighbors. Next, the mean and standard deviation of these average distances are computed to determine
    a distance threshold. The distance threshold is set to: :code:`mean + std_multiplier * stddev`. Then, points are
    classified as outlier and removed if their average neighbor distance is above this threshold.

    Args:
        xyz: Coordinates of the points to be filtered.
        k: Number of neighboring points to consider for the filtering (the point itself is not included).
        std_multiplier: Multiplier for the standard deviation in the calculation of the distance threshold.

    Returns:
        : Tuple of two arrays:
            - Coordinates of the inlier points remaining after filtering.
            - Indices of the inlier points remaining after filtering with respect to the input array.

    Shape:
        - :code:`xyz`: :math:`(N, 3)`
        - Output: :math:`(N', 3)`, :math:`(N')`
